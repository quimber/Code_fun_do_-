PREDICTION:
We can associate three aspects important to prediction:
-Simulations and understanding the cause and effect of the disaster
-Actual real time data from different sensors 
-Data of past events and analysing it
We’ll look at some brief ideas in each of these phases. Making disaster prediction as a science by itself and structuring it could increase outputs.
ACTUAL REAL TIME DATA:
                       My first pitch in this aspect is understanding the imminence of a natural disaster from nature itself. Some animals have extraordinary sensory abilities and there have been reports that animals being able to predict natural disasters in advance. These natural “detectors” have evolved over thousands of years can be relied upon to some extent. But currently, it is more of an informal method. So we need to study such methods formally and validate them for increased reliability. The available data is still too incomplete for such a warning system: more catastrophic events, more species must be analysed to find out which animals respond to which events and how reliable they are in their response. Once validated, it would be very useful. 
Now, we can start with animals which we already know can predict the disasters and track their movements using:
-Satellites
-GPS collars or other animal trackers
-Constant surveillance using cameras or surveillance drones
+After it’s validated that a particular animal’s movement is an indicator of an impending disaster, monitoring such things would be a real head ache. So, we can try to automate things here. We can invoke IOT where a group of sensors can be deployed in the wild which communicate with one another and spread the message about an impending disaster if the group of chipsets have gathered enough evidence. Say, for example if such a group of chipsets observe so many unusual animal movements at a time, all of them could trigger after communicating with one another. The chipsets should be such that they consume low power, have data properly encrypted and follow an appropriate communication protocol.
+Moreover, we could study how the animals are predicting such events and use biomimicking to create similar tools using modern technologies which could serve us in predicting natural disasters.
A few more points regarding getting data:
+If we are unable to measure a quantity that we want directly, we can switch to some other quantities which we know has a link to the actual quantity. Searching for and analysing such related quantities would help us better in data collection.
+ Another major issue is that we focus our data collection on places which are more prone to such disasters. But major damage occurs when the disaster hits a place which we hadn’t expected to be hit. For example, earthquakes may occur in places very far from the fault lines causing huge damages.

DATA of PAST EVENTS AND ANALYSING THEM:
We already have disaster prediction systems using data analytics and machine learning and other tools. The thing we need to do is to enhance such systems so that they can be more accurate and reliable. 
+We need to have a broader perspective while analysing.
   - For example, when we are trying to figure out whether an earthquake is going to hit the region using past data, we should analyse not only the earthquake pattern in this place but also other linked places.
   - Another thing is that, sometimes, seemingly unrelated things may be related to that disaster but the link might be hidden to us. So here again, our analysis should be broad. After all, the basic idea behind ML and related fields is to provide links between seemingly unrelated stuff.
+ An important point is that data from satellites should be studied very well. Since no other sources provide such wide and valuable data. We need to have a database of satellite data and it should be analysed properly in different aspects during times of disaster because it may reveal some very important hidden aspects. Since a lot of on earth events case a change in our atmosphere. For example, studying the charge quantity and their energies in the upper ionosphere could reveal information about an impending earthquake. (This is the concept behind IITMSAT) 

MANAGING:

My second pitch is that, 
During disaster times, it is difficult for rescue operations because of the damage created by the disaster and it becomes very difficult to rescue people and people go missing.
